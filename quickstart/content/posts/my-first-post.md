# Hello and Welcome!

I'm Hoang and this is where you'll find a collection of all my blog posts ranging from technical pieces on some subject that piqued my interest that day to seemingly random streams of conscisouness on some controversial subject and from my experiences in the software industry to my experiences as a millenial who grew up with working-class, refugees as parents who fled communist Vietnam. My goal with this blog is two-fold:

1. Share my learnings/meanderings on some technical or non-technical topic so that firstly I can better learn and remember the material but secondly so that others may coincidentally click with the way I've presented the material and consequently pick up something new!

2. Be introspective and use this blog as a canvas for my own thoughts and opinions on a random assortment of subjects with the express intent to dive deeply and assess critically the subject matter.

It's at this point where I should state the obligatory discretion that these posts contain content and options which are my own.

I am glad you found this page, and I hope you are able to gain something in the posts to come!
